### .secret
Store your username, pwd, client-id, and client-secret in .secret with the format: 
```
client-id: {CLIENT ID}
client-secret: {CLIENT SECRET}
username: {YOUR TICK TICK USERNAME}
pwd: {ur TICK TICK PASSWORD}
```
Remember to have .secret in .gitignore so you don't share your pass :). Also note the space after :.
